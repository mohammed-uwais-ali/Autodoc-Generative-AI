**Project Pitch**

-   **Name of Project:** Autodoc
-   **Problem to Solve:** Many developers write code without proper documentation, making it harder for others to understand or maintain their code. Autodoc solves this by automatically adding inline comments and README files to undocumented code.
-   **Interfaces:** Autodoc interfaces with users (developers) who provide code files, and with the OpenAI GPT API that generates documentation.
-   **Inputs:** Undocumented code files in various programming languages.
-   **Outputs:** The same code files, but with added inline comments and README files that provide explanations of the code.

-   **Steps from Input to Output:**
	-   User inputs the name of the file.
	-   Autodoc reads the code from the file.
	-   Autodoc sends the code to the OpenAI GPT API.
	-   Autodoc receives the generated documentation from the API.
	-   Autodoc writes the generated documentation back into the code file and creates a README file if necessary.


-   **Biggest Risk:** The OpenAI GPT API might generate incorrect or irrelevant documentation, or not understand some complex code structures.
-   **Measure of Success:** Autodoc will be successful if it can accurately and meaningfully document a variety of code files, saving developers time and making their code easier to understand.

**Project Specification**

-   **Usefulness:** Autodoc is aimed at developers who either don't have the time to document their code properly or who have inherited undocumented code. The minimum viable product (MVP) would be a tool that can handle Python code. Additional features could include support for other languages, the ability to handle multiple files at once, and integration with version control systems like Git.
-   **Technical Considerations:** The primary inputs are the code files themselves, and the output is the same code file with added inline documentation and a README file. The OpenAI GPT API is the key piece of technology that transforms the input into the output. Python's built-in file handling features will be used to read from and write to files.
-   **API Integration:** The OpenAI GPT API will be used to generate documentation.
-   **PEP8 Style:** The Autodoc codebase will adhere to PEP8 style guidelines.
-   **Testing Plan:** Unit tests will be written to ensure that Autodoc can read from and write to files correctly, handle various types of code structures, and interact with the OpenAI GPT API correctly. Edge cases such as empty files or non-code files will also be tested.
-   **GitHub Automation:** Style checkers and unit tests will be run automatically on GitHub using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
